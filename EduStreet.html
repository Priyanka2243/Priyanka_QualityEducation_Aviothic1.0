ABOUT INDIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM
</h1>
<br>
<p1>
The school education system in India is vast and complex. It is overseen by three national bodies: The All India Council for Technical Education, the University Grants Commission, and the National Council of Educational Research and Training. In addition to these, each state has its Department or Ministry of Education, which regulates school education within its jurisdiction.
In India, the literacy rate for people aged seven and above is 74.04%. The male literacy rate is 82.14% while the female literacy rate is 65.46%. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for higher education in India is 26.30%. The GER is the percentage of people aged 18-23 who are enrolled in higher education institutions. In India, there are more than 700 universities and 37000 colleges. The education system of India as a whole is not up to the mark. There are many problems in the education system. The quality of education is not good. There is a lot of corruption in the education system. The government is not doing enough to improve the education system.There are many private schools in India which are providing good quality education. But the fees of these schools are very high. So, only rich people can afford to send their children to these schools. Many public schools in India are not provided with good quality education. The government is not doing anything to improve the condition of these schools. The dropout rate is very high in India. Many students dropout of school before completing their education.

<h3>
ISSUES RELATED TO EDUCATION:
<h3>
<br>
<p3>
1. Lack of Infrastructure:<br>
Aapproximately 95.2 per cent of schools are not yet compliant with the complete set of RTE infrastructure indicators according to survey conducted in 2010.They lacks drinking water facilities, a functional common toilet, and do not have separate toilets for girls.<br>
<br>
 2. Poor global ranking of institutes: <br>
Only 4 universities are featured in first 400 This 00. This is largely because of high faculty-student ratio and lack of research capacity.<br>
<br>

3. System of education:<br>
 Education is information based rather than knowledge based. The whole focus is on information rather than understanding it and analyzing it. <br>
<br>
4. Gap between education provided and industry required education:<br>
 Industry faces a problem to find suitable employee as education provided is not suitable for directly working in industry so before that a company is required to spend large amount on providing training for employee. <br>
<br>
5. Gender issues:<br>
 Traditional Indian society suffers from many kind of discrimination so there are many hurdles in education of unprivileged sections of society.<br>
<br>
6. Costly higher education:<br>
 Very minimal amount of subsidy is provided for higher education so if student seeks to get chances of higher education still he misses out because of lack of economical resources. <br>
<br>
7. Inadequate government Funding:<br>
 The demand for financial resources far exceeds the supply. Very small amount is available for innovative programs and ideas. 
</p3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
HOW TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS
</h3>
<br>
<p3>
 1. Adoption of technology:<br>
 Effective use of technological tools in teaching has many benefits. It will solve the many problems of infrastructure, quality.<br>
<br>
2. Teacher training:<br>
 Teachers' training remains one of the most chaotic, neglected and deficient sectors of India's vast education system. This needs to be changed as they virtually hold the destiny of the future generations in their hands.<br>
<br>
 3. More government spending:<br>
 India targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Also funding is needed to be spend on building infrastructure.<br>
<br>
 4. Inclusive education system:<br>
 Growth in education sector should incorporate all sections of society like rural, urban poor ,woman Backward classes etc.<br>
<br>
 5. Quality education:<br>
 Education provided should meet needs of student. e.g. education provided to hearing impaired or slow learners. It should allow them to enhance their skills and get better employment options.<br>
<br>
 6. Education policy:<br>
Education policy need frequent update. It should cover personality development aspect of students it should also imbibe values of culture and social services.<br>

<h3>
WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS FACED BY FIRST GENERATION SCHOOL GOES?
</h3>
<br>
<p3>
1.Family Background and support:<br>
Family background is quiet different for such children.They might  not get same support as other students have and that will have huge psychological impact.Sometimes their family can not fulfill their resources need.<br>
 2. Different socio-economic opportunities:<br>
 First generation school-goers might come from poor or lower middle class so less socio- economic opportunities are there for them as compared to other students.<br>
 3. Too much pressure on them:<br>
 First generation school-goers undergo a lot of pressure as their family has a lot of expectations from them.<br>
 4. Lack of guidance at home:<br>
 Nobody is able to solve the problems in their studies at home as other members of family are illiterate. In that case they have to rely largely on guidance at school.<br>
 5. Feeling of insecurity:<br>
 Approach toward them might be different that will cause insecure feeling among them.<br>
